## About Me

Hello! I’m **Polina Morozova**, a junior QA specialist with a strong attention to detail, a structured mindset, and a background in customer-facing roles. I’m currently transitioning into software testing with a focus on mobile and web applications. I have hands-on experience testing a real mobile app (CrochetApp – Row Counter App), and I continuously improve my skills through online courses, testing tasks, and project-based learning.

## Projects

### CrochetApp – Row Counter App

A mobile app built using Flutter and Firebase, designed to help users track progress on crochet projects. It includes counters, pattern libraries, PDF uploads, and Apple Watch sync. I explored the app manually and completed a structured QA review.

#### Test Scenarios and Functional Grouping

- Categorized all major features (Counters, Patterns, PDFs, Settings, etc.)
- Prioritized based on risk, frequency of use, and user flow dependencies
- Outlined the regression testing execution order

#### Bug Reports

- Identified UI, usability, and logical bugs
- Used structured bug report format (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual result, impact, priority)
- Focused on issues that affect user experience and consistency

#### Test Case – Email Authentication

- Wrote a detailed test case for the "Continue with Email" login flow
- Included edge cases like blank input, invalid email, successful login
- Test case includes preconditions, test steps, expected results, and post-conditions

#### Questions for Developers/Product Owner

- Compiled clarifying questions about backend behavior, data validation, feature logic, and sync across devices  
[View File](link-to-questions.md)

#### External Factors and Test Environment

- Considered how app behavior may vary based on device model, OS version, screen resolution, network strength

#### Tools & Debugging Setup

- Described tools I used and would use for further testing and debugging (Postman, Notion, Firebase Emulator, DevTools)  
[View File](link-to-tools.md)

#### API and Backend Testing Ideas

- Proposed beginner-friendly approach to test backend logic using Postman
- Mentioned how to simulate load/stress with JMeter and monitor Firestore
